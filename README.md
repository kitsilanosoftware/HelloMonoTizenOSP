HelloTizen
==========

The "Hello World" application from the Tizen SDK, converted from C++ to C#.

This application can only be opened in MonoDevelop / Xamarin Studio.

No support is currently planned for Visual Studio.

Just install the Tizen add-in (see http://kitsilanosoftware.github.io/MonoDevelop.Tizen/) and then open the SLN file.
