HelloMonoTizenOSP
=================

The "Hello World" UI application from the Tizen SDK, converted from C++ to C#.

OSP is "Open Service Platform" and is the name of the Bada platform which was integrated into Tizen 2.0.   OSP is dual-licensed as Apache and Flora, so is OSI-compliant.

This example application can only be opened in MonoDevelop / Xamarin Studio.  We do not plan to build any IDE integration for Visual Studio at the time of writing.

The application runs successfully on a Samsung Z physical device and will be submitted to the Tizen Store imminently.
